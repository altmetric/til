# Today I Learned

We constantly learn new things. This is a place to share them.

TILs are short documents explaining concepts, syntax, tips or other features we've recently learned.

Inspired by, and in no way a complete rip-off of, [Thoughtbot's TIL][thoughtbot-til], which itself contains loads of really useful learnings.
