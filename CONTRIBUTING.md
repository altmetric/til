# Contributing

When you have learned something new, add a Markdown file to this repository explaining it in concise terms.

Make sure your file is placed in a directory which best describes the content of the tip -- creating a new one if no existing one fits -- and that the file itself describes the nugget of learning contained within.

Then open a pull request for review.

**NB: Do not use this repo for company-specific information. For that, use the _How-To_ or other sections on the corporate wiki.**

## What makes a good TIL?

A TIL should be a focused and concise piece of knowledge that's interesting and
worth sharing with others.

Here's some guidelines on how to write a great TIL:

* Avoid writing more than 60 lines of content.
* Avoid writing more than 2 examples.
* Avoid going into too much detail.

If you find that your TIL is outgrowing these suggested limits, you could try focussing down to a key point. Or it may be a sign that you have a blog post to write.
